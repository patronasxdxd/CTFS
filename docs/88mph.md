# 88mph


## What's 88mph?

88mph is an Ethereum-based, decentralized application (dApp) 
for users who want to borrow and lend at a fixed interest rate. 
But instead of being a self-contained protocol, 88mph is actually a mediator
for more popular third-party lending dApps, such as Aave or Compound. Itâ€™s designed
for advanced DeFi investors who understand the perils of financial complexity.

## Vulnerability
```unprotected init()```



## Analysis

In the MPHNFT contract, there was a vulnerability present in 
init() function, which allowed any user to claim ownership of the contract. 

### Exploited code

```solidity
    function init( 
        address newOwner,
        string calldata tokenName,
        string calldata tokenSymbol
    ) external {
        _transferOwnerShip(newOwner);
        _tokenName = tokenName;
        _tokenSymbol = tokenSymbol;

        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721_METADATA);
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC165);
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ERC721);
    }
```

Best practices recommend using a constructor or an initialization 
guard to ensure that the initialization process happens only once.

```solidity
    bool private initialized = false;

    modifier onlyUninitialized() {
          require(!initialized, "MPHNFT: already initialized");
          _;
      }

    function init( 
        address newOwner,
        string calldata tokenName,
        string calldata tokenSymbol
    ) external onlyUninitialized {
        initialized = true;

        _transferOwnerShip(newOwner);
        _tokenName = tokenName;
        _tokenSymbol = tokenSymbol;

        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721_METADATA);
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC165);
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ERC721);

    }
```

# proof of concept (PoC) 

We retrieve the historical state of the smart contract prior to the exploit through the use of `createSelectFork`, which creates a fork of the specified network.

Because of the lack of access control we can simply call the `init` function to 
claim owner ship of the contract

Now that contract ownership has been established, 
it does not imply ownership of all the NFTs. However,
we gain the ability to manipulate the NFTs by using the `burn` operation 
to delete existing tokens and the `mint` operation to create new ones.
