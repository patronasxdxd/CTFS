## Whats agave?

Agave ($AGVE) is a decentralized money market protocol on the xDai chain, developed by the 1Hive community as a fork of Aave. Agave integrates features from 1Hive projects like Celeste and Honeyswap.

Users deposit tokens, receiving 'aTokens' that accrue interest and can be used as collateral for borrowing. This enables leveraged returns with lower fees than mainnet Ethereum. Agave expands 1Hive's offerings, allowing users to earn yield on Honeyswap liquidity tokens. Explore Agave's capabilities, including lending, borrowing, delegated borrowing, and flash loans/
